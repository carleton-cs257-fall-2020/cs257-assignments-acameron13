STATUS: We were able to implement 2 of our goals, which included a searchable
table of data as well as an interactive map of the world. The map shows us
what cities in each country have hosted an Olympic Games and the shading
of each country represents the total number of medals won in Olympic history.
Additionally, when a country is clicked on the map, the page will navigate to
the search section with the team filter automatically filled in. Our website
functions as we want it to, but can be slow at times.

NOTES: From our initial proposal, we wish we could have implemented a few more
features. For example, we would have liked to be able to sort the table by
the various columns or display dots on the map representing the cities, rather
than including them in the popup menus. We also had planned to implement another
data visualization. If we had more time on this project, we would have loved to
implement some of these features, but we are proud of what we were able to
accomplish.
