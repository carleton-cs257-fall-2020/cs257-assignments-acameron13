	Our dataset is data from Olympic athletes, events, and results from the past 120 years, including both Summer and Winter games.
The data includes every athlete that competed with their respective team and country, along with physical characteristics.

Stories:

STORY: I'm a gambler and it's time to make some money this upcoming Olympic Games. I need statistics on which countries have been
most productive in winning medals so I can make a confident bet on the medal counts for these games.

IMPLEMENTATION: We want to have a data visualization that shows a line graph of the total medals for a given country for each year. We will have a
default setting that places the line segments of every country on one graph. From there, a user can specify a country of which they want to
analyze alone (a visualization similar to the baby name website we talked about in class).
