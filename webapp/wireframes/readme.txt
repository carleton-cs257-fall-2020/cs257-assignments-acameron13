This map will be the first graphic that the user views when they open our website. As of 
now, we only have a few countries shaded in, but when we actually implement it, we will
shade every country based on their total medal count (darker countries will indicate teams
that have won the most medals and lighter to white shaded countries will be the teams 
which have won the least). In addition, we will have dots for every city in which an 
Olympic Games have occurred. When the user hovers over the city's dot, we will display 
information about which games were held there (season, year, city). From there, a user can 
click on a specific games and will be taken to the search tab with that games already
selected in the games field.

This graph can be viewed if the user scrolls down below the map. By default, it will 
display the progression of medals won by every country for every sport. Name of team can 
be seen when hovering over specific line. If the user only wants to view one country or 
look at one specific sport, they can indicate this using drop-down menus.

3) search.PNG

Search tab, allows users to search for data by specifying what they want to analyze 
using the athlete search bar and field drop-down menus. The user can also sort the data
by each field (indicated by the arrows).
