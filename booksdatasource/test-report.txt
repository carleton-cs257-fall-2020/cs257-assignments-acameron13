Things that I fixed:
-In the setUp() function, we hadn't initialized the object correctly, so I changed
our input to strings and made sure they were the test csvs.
-A few typos here and there that I only caught when I ran the tests
-I got a warning saying to use assertEqual() instead of assertEquals(), so I changed
all of those
-We had misunderstood the situations where a ValueError would be raised for an
invalid author id. We thought that an empty list would be returned if the
author id was an integer but wasn't contained in the dataset, but in reality,
this situation raises a ValueError. I changed what was our "empty list" test so
that it made sure a ValueError is raised.


Bugs in Jeff's implementation:
-The death year in each author's dictionary is represented as a string rather
than an integer. The test that caught this was my test_authorf_search_text_exists().
I changed the implementation in booksdatasource.py so that it would be an integer,
and then it solved another error in test_authorf_search_text_none() as well. So
really, both of those tests caught that bug in the implementation.
